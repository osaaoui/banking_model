She stated that Wells Fargo is shutting my card down and issuing out a new one. XXXX had my personal information like the last four of my Social Security and my cellphone number. She went on to say I will be receiving a verification code through a text message and to give her the number once I receive it. I did and she told me to hold on and not to hang up.

I then hung checked my account and found that there was a {$2000.00} wire transfer out of my account.
